# the-allsite
A starter kit for your own Hugo site. Yes!

This template repository is meant to help jumpstart a hugo-generated site through services like Cloudflare Pages. 

How to Use it:

1. Create a repository for yourself by clicking / tapping "Use this Template."
2. If you don't have a Cloudflare account, create one for free.
3. Add your repository to your Cloudflare Pages account (authorize Pages to access the repository).
4. On Cloudflare Pages, create a new project, and use your new repository.  
5. Specify Hugo as the Framework Preset. This will auto-fill the build command and output directory. 
6. Include HUGO_VERSION as an environment variable. Use 0.82.1 as the value (or any version above 0.54).
7. Deploy!
